10. Implement internationalization (i18n) in an Angular project.
 

To implement internationalization (i18n) in an Angular project, follow these steps using the provided variables:



1. Install the necessary dependencies: Run the command ng add [@angular](https://hero.page/angular)/localize to add the Angular localization package to your project.



2. Set up localization: In the src folder, create a new folder named locales and inside it create the necessary translation files for each language you want to support. Name each file as

locale_id

.xlf, where

locale_id

is the corresponding language code (e.g., en, fr, de).



3. Extract the texts to be translated: Run the command ng extract-i18n --output-path=src/locales to generate the master translation file messages.xlf in the locales folder.



4. Translate the texts: Copy the messages.xlf file and rename it to

target_locale_id

.xlf with the target language code (e.g., es, it, pt). Then, add the translations for each text in the newly created file.



5. Configure the build process: In the angular.json file, add a new section called "i18n" and configure it with the following properties - sourceLocale (set it as

source_locale

), and locales (an object with keys for each target language and values as the path to the respective

target_locale_id

.xlf file).



6. Update the project's bootstrap file: In the src folder, open the main.ts file and add the following import statement at the beginning - import '[@angular](https://hero.page/angular)/localize/init';.



7. Mark strings for translation: In the project's HTML templates, use the i18n attribute to identify texts that need translation. You can also add a description for translators using the syntax `i18n="

tag_description

"`.



8. Configure language selection: Implement a mechanism for users to select the desired language using either a dropdown or any other suitable UI element. Store the selected language code (e.g., in a variable called

selected_language

) and use it to update the displayed translations accordingly.



9. Update the runtime_lang: In the app.module.ts file, update the runtime_lang by importing the following code - import { registerLocaleData } from '[@angular](https://hero.page/angular)/common'; and register the locale data for each language to be supported in the Angular project.



10. Test the implementation: Build the Angular project with translations for each language by running the command ng build --prod --localize. This will generate one build for each locale configured in the angular.json file. Check if the translations are displayed correctly in the application when switching between languages.



This dynamic prompt should help you implement internationalization (i18n) in your Angular project and adapt the displayed texts based on the user's language preferences.
