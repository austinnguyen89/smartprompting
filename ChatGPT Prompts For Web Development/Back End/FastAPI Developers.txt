3. Generating and returning a JWT token as part of the response if authentication is successful.



Additionally, provide an example of how to test the implemented route to ensure it functions properly.





3. Write a middleware function to protect specific routes by requiring a valid JWT token in the request header. If the token is not present or invalid, return a 401 Unauthorized response.
 

Create a technical guide on how to write a middleware function for protecting specific routes using a JWT token. The guide should cover the following key points:



1. The main goal of the middleware function is to verify the presence of a valid

token_type

token in the request header.

2. If the token is absent or invalid, the middleware should return a

error_code

error response.

3. The specific routes you want to protect are:

route_1

,

route_2

, and

route_3

.

4. Provide step-by-step instructions for implementing the middleware function and securing the specified routes.

5. Include sample code for the middleware function, preferably in

programming_language

.



Please make sure to use clear language and proper formatting for easy readability.

4. Create a CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) API for managing blog posts using FastAPI and the Tortoise-ORM library. The blog post should have the following fields: `title`, `content`, `author_id`, `created_at`, and `updated_at`.
 

Create a tutorial on building a CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) API for managing blog posts using FastAPI and the Tortoise-ORM library, with focus on

specific_topic

. Include code examples and explanations for working with the following fields: title, content, author_id, created_at, and updated_at. Explain the role of

dynamic_variable

in the process and demonstrate how to create and manipulate data using the API.





5. Implement pagination and filtering for the blog post list endpoint to allow users to browse through a large number of posts easily. Include options for sorting by date, author, and title.
 

Create a technical guide explaining how to implement pagination, filtering, and sorting for a blog post list endpoint, allowing users to easily browse through a large number of posts. The guide should cover the following features: (1) pagination with

page_size

and

page_number

parameters, (2) filtering by

filter_author

and

filter_date

, and (3) sorting by

sort_date

,

sort_author

, and

sort_title

. Additionally, provide examples of how to use the parameters in combination with each other to create customized browsing experiences.





6. Set up FastAPI's built-in TestClient for writing test cases and write tests covering all major functionality: user registration, user authentication, CRUD operations for blog posts, and pagination/filtering/sorting.
 

Write a tutorial on setting up FastAPI's built-in TestClient for writing test cases, covering the following major functionalities: (1) user registration, (2) user authentication, (3) CRUD operations for blog posts, and (4) pagination/filtering/sorting. Include explanations and code snippets for each functionality, using

language_1

for backend and

language_2

for frontend. Demonstrate how to use variables in the test cases appropriately, like

test_user

,

test_post

, and

test_auth_payload

. Highlight best practices for ensuring complete test coverage and maintaining test integrity throughout the project.





7. Configure rate limiting middleware for the FastAPI application to prevent abuse and ensure fair usage of the API. Limit endpoints to a specific number of requests per minute based on user roles (e.g., 60 requests per minute for regular users, 120 requests per minute for administrators).
 

Create a step-by-step guide on configuring rate limiting middleware for a FastAPI application using

middleware_tool

to prevent abuse and ensure fair usage. Describe setting up the following limitations based on user roles:

limit_regular_users

requests per minute for regular users, and

limit_admin_users

requests per minute for administrators. Also, elaborate on the process of applying these limits to the specific API endpoints.





8. Implement a WebSocket chat feature using FastAPI's WebSocket support. Authenticate users using the JWT token, and store chat messages in a database. Also, create a function to fetch the chat history from the database.
 

Design and implement an 8-step guide on creating a WebSocket chat feature using FastAPI for

software_project

. Include the following steps:



1. Setting up the FastAPI framework and initializing the WebSocket support.
