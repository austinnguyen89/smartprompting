3. Create a Firestore security rule in Firebase for ensuring that only authenticated users with a specific role (e.g. admin) can access particular collections and documents.
 

Create a step-by-step guide on how to implement a Firestore security rule in Firebase to ensure that only authenticated users with a specific role (e.g.

role

) can access certain collections and documents. Include explanations and examples for each step, taking into consideration the following aspects:



1. Setting up Firebase and Firestore in the project.

2. Creating user authentication and assigning roles (e.g.

role

) to users.

3. Writing the Firestore security rule that allows only users with the

role

role to access the specified collections and documents.

4. Testing the security rule with different user roles and access attempts.



Please provide a clear and concise explanation suitable for users with some experience in Firebase but new to Firestore security rules.





4. Develop a deployment script using Firebase CLI that deploys functions, Firestore rules, and Realtime Database rules to a specific Firebase environment (e.g., development, staging, or production).
 

Create a tutorial on developing a deployment script for a

specific_environment

(e.g., development, staging, or production) using the Firebase CLI, including the following aspects:



1. Deploying functions with

function_name

,

2. Configuring Firestore rules using

firestore_rules_file

, and

3. Implementing Realtime Database rules with

realtime_database_rules_file

.

6. Write a TypeScript function using Firebase Functions to fetch data from an external API, process the response, and store the results in Firestore or Realtime Database.
 

Create a TypeScript tutorial for a Firebase Function, where

developer

needs to fetch data from an external API using

api_endpoint

, process the received data with the

processing_function

function, and then store the results in a

database_type

database (Firestore or Realtime Database). Include steps to install necessary packages, to initialize Firebase Functions, and to write the actual function in TypeScript.





7. Develop an automated backup script using Node.js to perform daily backups of Firestore and Realtime Database data and store the backups in a Google Cloud Storage bucket.
 

Create a step-by-step tutorial on developing an automated backup script using Node.js for daily backups of data from Firestore and Realtime Database, and storing them in a Google Cloud Storage bucket. Make sure to include variables for

database_type

,

backup_frequency

storage_bucket_name

in the instructions.





8. Implement a Firebase Function in TypeScript for processing user-generated content (e.g., images or text) using the Firebase Storage, and moderate it using Google Cloud Vision API to flag inappropriate content and store the moderated content in Firestore or Realtime Database.
 

Write a step-by-step guide on implementing a Firebase Function in TypeScript to process user-generated content such as

content_type

(images or text) using Firebase Storage. Moderate the content using Google Cloud Vision API to flag inappropriate material and store the moderated content in

database_type

(Firestore or Realtime Database). Include code examples and explanations for each step to ensure a clear understanding of the implementation process.
