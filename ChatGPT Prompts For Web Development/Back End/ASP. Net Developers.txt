6. Setting up the

dashboard_name

dashboard to monitor and manage scheduled tasks.

7. Demonstrating how to use the

dashboard_name

dashboard to monitor the status of the

sample_task

, view task history, and manually trigger/retry tasks.



Please ensure to provide code examples and explanations for each step. Finally, include any best practices or tips for using the

library

library in an ASP.NET application.



8. Implement an error handling and logging mechanism in an ASP.NET web application. The code should capture exceptions and log them into a central repository such as a database, file, or an external service like Sentry or Loggly.
 

Design a code snippet for an ASP.NET web application that implements error handling and logging mechanism. The code should include

error_handling_method

, which captures exceptions, and
