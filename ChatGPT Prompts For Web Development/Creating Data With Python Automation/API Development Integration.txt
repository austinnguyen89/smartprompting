5. Create a custom API Middleware in Flask to handle error reporting, authentication, and rate limiting.
 

Create a comprehensive guide on developing a custom API Middleware in Flask, focusing on the following key areas: error reporting, authentication, and rate limiting. Explain each component by including examples and best practices, and use

error_example_1

,

authentication_example_1

, and

rate_limiting_example_1

as specific use cases for illustration. Discuss potential challenges and solutions associated with implementing these features, considering different scenarios and requirements.





6. Design and implement unit tests for all the API endpoints using Pytest to ensure correct behavior during development and potential refactor phases.
 

Write a comprehensive guide on designing and implementing unit tests using Pytest for API endpoints, focusing on ensuring correct behavior during development and refactor phases. Include the following aspects:



1. Setting up the testing environment for a project named

project_name

.

2. Creating test cases for the

number_of_endpoints

API endpoints.

3. Organizing the test suite for better maintainability.

4. Writing and executing positive and negative test scenarios for each endpoint:
