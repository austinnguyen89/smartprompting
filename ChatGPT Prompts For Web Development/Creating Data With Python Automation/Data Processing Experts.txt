6. Request: Develop a Python script using Dask to process and analyze large volumes of image files stored remotely (e.g., S3 storage or Hadoop) by reading the images in parallel, perform image transformations (resize, crop, flip), and save the processed images into a specified output folder.
 

Create a step-by-step guide on developing a Python script using Dask to process and analyze a large volume of

file_type

files stored on a remote platform like

remote_storage

(e.g., S3 storage or Hadoop). The guide should cover how to read the images in parallel, perform image transformations such as

transformation_1

,

transformation_2

, and

transformation_3

(e.g., resize, crop, flip), and save the processed images into a specified output folder named

output_folder

.





7. Request: Write a Python function using Pandas to merge two datasets based on a common key column and perform data validations/comparisons between the merged data by identifying unmatched records, conflicting data, and updating the merged data with any required data-quality checks.
 

Write a step-by-step explanation on how to create a Python function using the Pandas library to merge two datasets,

dataset_1

and

dataset_2

, based on their common key column,

key_column

. Additionally, include the necessary techniques for validating and comparing the merged data by identifying unmatched records, conflicting data, and updating the merged dataset with any required data-quality checks.





8. Request: Develop a Python script using Numpy to generate synthetic data (numeric and categorical) based on user-specified parameters (number of rows, columns, distribution type), and then apply machine learning algorithms (e.g., clustering or classification) on the generated dataset.
 

Create a step-by-step guide for developing a Python script that uses Numpy to generate synthetic data (both numeric and categorical) based on user-defined parameters: number of rows (

rows

), number of columns (

columns

), and distribution type (

distribution

). Then, explain how to apply machine learning algorithms, such as clustering or classification, on the generated dataset.





9. Request: Implement a Python script using Dask to analyze and visualize time-series data stored in multiple CSV files by reading the data asynchronously, perform time-based aggregations (hourly, daily, monthly summary statistics), and plot the output using appropriate visualization tools (e.g., line plot or heatmap).
 

Create a step-by-step guide on implementing a Python script for

user_name

to analyze and visualize time-series data using Dask. The data is stored in multiple CSV files, and needs to be read asynchronously. The script should include the following tasks:
